 I am an enthusiastic geospatial data analyst currently leading the Sustainable Energy for All team at KTH. My work focuses on linking Geographic Information  Systems  (GIS)  and  energy  systems models to support planning and/or policy for rural electrification. 
 Over the past years I have been working on enhancing key components of the OnSSET model and as well as coordinating several projects with key partners inclucing the World Bank, UNDESA, IEA, SNV and ABB.

 Looking forward, I am highly motivated by the great potential of <mark>remote sensing</mark>, <mark>big data</mark> & <mark>data science</mark> in supporting solutions towards
 sustainable development. Thus, very much interested in expanding my technical and analytical skills in these areas and dedicate my work on tackling complex problems of our world.

 **Expertise:** Geospatial analysis, energy access, electrification planning, capacity building & knowledge transfer
