    The Global Electrification Platform (GEP) is a multi-phase project aiming at improving, standardizing, and simplifying the use of geospatial tools in least-cost electrification planning. 
    It's front end is an open web platform for exploring electrification plans for all countries battling with energy access. Scenarios are based on the OnSSET model developed by KTH dESA.
    Both front and back end code of this project is open source, being designed upon the principles of transparency; it aspires to enable reusability, replicability and reproducibility of embedded processes and data.

    The project employs a novel, modular and open source methodology to  allow for delivery  of multi-layered  insights  into  estimated  quantity  and  characteristics  of electricity demand from agricultural activities (irrigation & post harvest processing) in Mozambique. The project is a collaboration between KTH dESA and Vivid Economics, and part  of  a  multi-year WB ESMAP effort entitled “Geospatial  Electrification  Planning  in  the  Africa Region”.

    Developing a spatially-explicit model that determines, for two time steps (2025 and 2030), the electrification strategy that delivers electricity access at the lowest cost for several Geographical zones in Sub-Saharan Africa.
    The outcome is expected to feature IEA's Special Report on Africa (November 2019) as part of the World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2019 series.  Tho objective is to provide an in-depth analysis, quantitatively investigating today’s picture for access to modern energy, the strategies and technologies that can enable countries to achieve energy for all by 2030, and the ways in which reliable energy can move communities from poverty towards prosperity.

    Integrated geospatial electrification planning activity to assess potential electrification futures in Benin. The analysis was conducted using the OnSSET tool, utilising local data and involving key stakeholders from government, the private sector and academia. The final output includes a report in English and French and an open source code.

    This study explores the technological options and investment requirements needed to boost electricity access levels in Afghanistan and presents a method for performing a spatial based electrification analysis. 
    As part of the World Bank’s wider effort to inform investments focused on increasing Afghans’ access to affordable and sustainable energy, the study offers an initial, “quick pass” at selected data to provide a sense of scale and to inform a more detailed analysis to be performed at a later date

    This project uses geospatial data and OnSSET to determine the most cost-effective conventional and renewable energy technologies for bringing electricity to specific localities. It is designed to identify means of providing access to safe, affordable and reliable electricity to households that currently do not have it. 
    The model compares options such as connections to the electrical grid, and mini-grid or stand-alone systems. It factors in population density, distance to transmission and road networks, renewable energy potential, fuel prices and estimated electricity consumption per household, among other considerations.
    Results of the model were vizualized in an interactive platform developed and operated by UNDESA.
